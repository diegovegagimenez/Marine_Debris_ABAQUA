# Marine_Debris_ABAQUA

The objective of the present project is to conduct a study on the optimization of the marine debris collecting service strategy at two levels, the first for seasonal planning and the second for daily operations planning. This study would is articulated as follows:

T1: Characterization of the spatial variability of marine litter with modeling tools and through an analysis of data from cleanup boats for the period 2005-2022.
This task would consist of the following steps:
  T1.1: Homogenization of the database and quality control.
  T1.2: Carrying out a multi-annual retro-analysis to identify the evolution of discharges in different coastal areas and the evolution of discharges in the open sea. 
  T1.3: Analysis of the variability of observations and simulations including cross-validation
  T1.4: Drafting of a report on the optimal areas where to concentrate clean-up efforts by season taking into account the modes of operation of the vessels and the        potential ports of departure.

T2: Study of the feasibility of a predictive system in order to plan the optimal strategy for daily operation.
This task would consist of the following steps:
  T2.1: Study on the predictability of marine debris concentrations based on the evaluation of numerical simulations and statistical properties of the observed time series.
  T2.2: Development of a predictive model based on the combination of numerical and observational results.
  T2.3: Drafting of a report on possible clean-up strategies to take advantage of short-term predictions taking into account the modes of operation of the vessels.
